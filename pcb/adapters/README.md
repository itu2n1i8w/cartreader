#### sms_adapter.zip is an add-on for reading Sega Master System carts. You can order a 2.54mm 50pin SMS slot [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32818469880.html). The adapter is based on the [design by Raphnet](https://www.raphnet.net/electronique/sms_to_smd/index_en.php). For use with the Cart Reader ignore the SMD footprints on the PCB, the adapter does not need any components. I only bridged R5 to connect the reset line, although I'm not sure if this is even needed. Unlike the other adapters this one plugs into the MD slot.

For [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/) you need to [rename filename.GML to filename.GKO](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rcvhalgeu11sf8/rename.jpg?dl=0) or it won't find the board outline. Oshpark is great for ordering the smaller PCBs but very expensive for larger boards.
