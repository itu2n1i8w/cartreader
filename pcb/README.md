#### cartreader.zip is the main PCB, if you order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/quote) you usually get a coupon displayed during the checkout for buying parts [from lcsc.com](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/Needed-Parts). [Default settings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06dnus50ikmsmya/pcb16.jpg?dl=0) are fine, just select the color you prefer and off you go. If this is your first order from JLCPCB you should only pay $2 for 5 PCBs.
