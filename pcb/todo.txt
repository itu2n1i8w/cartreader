This is a collection of ideas for a future PCB revision:

- remove the two 10k pull-up resistors from buttons, pull up the pins in software instead
- remove EEP switch and just leave 1K resistor enabled all the time
- remove CLK0 switch, connect SNES Pin 1 (CLK) permanently to Clock Gen Clk0 pin
- remove CLK1 switch, connect SNES Pin 57 (CPU Clock) permanently to Clock Gen Clk1 pin, connect N64 Pin 19 (CLK) and GBA Pin 2 (CLK) to Arduino Pin 16 (PH1)
- remove 3.3/5V switch, use currently un-used Arduino Pins 18,19 (PD3,PD2) and some form of transistor or mosfet to switch between voltages, Arduino should not reset if switched fast enough
- change pinout of flash_adapter to not use Arduino Pin 7(PH4) and 16(PH1) for WE and OE but instead Arduino Pin 8(PH5) and 6(PH3) like the Chinese SNES repros do.
- integrate sd_adapter.sch, nes_adapter.sch and famicom_adapter.sch into main PCB
- integrate Mega2560 and CH340 chips into main PCB instead of using a complete Arduino Mega
- change board layout to something simpler, similar to INF NES Lives dumper and make any 3D printed parts optional
- remove solder jumpers for choosing between the two different OLED pinouts and just specify the needed OLED pinout
- change RGB LED to SMD
- try using the 16Mhz clock output of the Atmega(must be enabled through fuse setting) and a frequency divider to 4Mhz instead of the clock generator to power SNES Expansion Clock, snesCIC and SNES CPU Clock, 4Mhz should be "close enough"
- integrate battery charging circuit and LiPo battery like on makho's portable GBA version
- check if any of the currently unconnected pins on the different cart slots needs to be connected for some special carts
- move all SMD parts to a single PCB side
