#### cartreader.zip is the main PCB, if you order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/quote) you can [combine shipping with your parts order from lcsc.com](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/Needed-Parts). [Default settings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06dnus50ikmsmya/pcb16.jpg?dl=0) are fine, just select the color you prefer and off you go. If this is your first order from JLCPCB you should only pay $2 for 5 PCBs.

#### adapter_pcbs.zip are additional PCBs for writing flash- and eproms like the 29F032, 29L3211, 29LV160 or 27C322, [PCB thickness needs to be changed to 1.2mm] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/va1c72073cqfy90/pcb12.jpg?dl=0), this is very important or else it won't fit into the SNES slot. It's best to order this design from [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html) as JLCPCB will charge you $16 extra for 3 designs.

#### With the sd_adapter PCB you can transform the microSD module from the parts list into a full size SD module by desoldering all the components and soldering them to this PCB. This is optional since you can also just mount the microSD module as is.

For [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/) you need to [rename filename.GML to filename.GKO](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rcvhalgeu11sf8/rename.jpg?dl=0) or it won't find the board outline. Oshpark is great for ordering the smaller PCBs but very expensive for larger boards.
