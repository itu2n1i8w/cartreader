#### cartreader.zip is the main PCB, if you order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/quote) you usually get a coupon displayed during the checkout for buying parts [from lcsc.com](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/Needed-Parts). [Default settings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06dnus50ikmsmya/pcb16.jpg?dl=0) are fine, just select the color you prefer and off you go. If this is your first order from JLCPCB you should only pay $2 for 5 PCBs.

#### nes_adapter.zip is an add-on for reading NES carts, [PCB thickness needs to be changed to 1.2mm](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/va1c72073cqfy90/pcb12.jpg?dl=1), this is very important or else it won't fit into the SNES slot. You can order a 2.5mm 72pin NES slot [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32827561164.html).

#### sms_adapter.zip is an add-on for reading Sega Master System carts. You can order a 2.54mm 50pin SMS slot [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32818469880.html). Ignore the SMD footprints on the PCB, the adapter does not need any components.

#### flash_adapter.zip is an add-on for writing flashroms like the 29F032, 29L3211, 29LV160, [PCB thickness needs to be changed to 1.2mm](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/va1c72073cqfy90/pcb12.jpg?dl=1), this is very important or else it won't fit into the SNES slot.

#### eprom_adapter.zip is an add-on for writing an 27C322 eprom, [PCB thickness needs to be changed to 1.2mm](https://www.dropbox.com/s/va1c72073cqfy90/pcb12.jpg?dl=0), this is very important or else it won't fit into the SNES slot.

#### With the sd_adapter PCB you can transform the microSD module from the parts list into a full size SD module by desoldering all the components and soldering them to this PCB. This is optional since you can also just mount the microSD module as is.

For [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/) you need to [rename filename.GML to filename.GKO](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rcvhalgeu11sf8/rename.jpg?dl=0) or it won't find the board outline. Oshpark is great for ordering the smaller PCBs but very expensive for larger boards.
