### Important: HW5 is still an untested work-in-progress and PCB files might contain errors. 

The Open Source Cart Reader consists out of a main PCB that connects an Arduino Mega to different cartridge slot adapters.     
To order a PCB you need to download the zipped gerber files and upload them to a PCB manufacturer. You don't have to change any of the settings but you can select a color you like.    

You can view the schematic and PCB files using [KiCad 6.0](https://www.kicad.org/).   
To design your own adapters you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/Designing-your-own-Adapters)
